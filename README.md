A .net multimedia search engine I made when I was 16.

This is probably the first major project I ever made and since it's about 6-7 years old it doesn't reflect my current coding standards.

For a more recent example of my current Java/C# abilities, check out [my updated C# scholarship program](https://github.com/day-me-an/scholarship-.net4).
